# PCBuilderApp
A final project app for CS4530. Created by McKay Fenn and [Neal Phelps](https://github.com/nphelpsiv).

All the functionality is working and it follows our original outline. 
We just need to continue updating the json file with the list of parts.
Which can be done by hosting the file and getting the data from there.

Users can create new builds and interactively select their parts. They can create new custom parts that can be used as any other.
They can sort parts by price. They can view specific parts on newegg.com. And they can save their builds.
